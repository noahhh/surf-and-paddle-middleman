  name: Annie Easley
  post: After graduating from high school, Ms. Annie J. Easley began her career in 1955 as a “human computer” for NASA’s predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). At a time when machine calculation was limited to key-punched cards manually fed into enormous machines capable only of multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division, Ms. Easley was part of a team responsible for calculating (by hand, mind you) the complex mathematical functions needed by scientists (like logarithms, exponentials, and square roots.
        While still employed by the NACA, Ms. Easley earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Cleveland State University in 1977. She also participated in continuing education and specialization programs specifically sponsored by the National Atmospheric and Space Administration (NASA).
        During her 34 year career with NACA (and later, NASA), Ms. Easley is credited as being one of the first African American women in the field of rocket science, mathematics, and computer sciences. She helped develop the software for the Centaur Rocket – a high-energy rocket that came to be known as ‘America’s Workhorse in Space”. She developed and implemented computer code that analyzed alternative power technologies for electric vehicles. She also studied technologies for wind and solar energies, as well as solving problems of energy monitoring and conservation. Some of Easley’s work helped lead the way to the development of batteries for modern Hybrid cars.
        Easley’s work on the Centaur project helped develop the technological foundations for space shuttle launches, as well as launches of communication, military and weather satellites. Her work contributed to the 1997 flight to Saturn of the Cassini probe, which was launched by the Centaur.
        Annie’s work helped make modern-day space flight possible — and for this, we salute her.

  name: Alan Turing
  post: With the outbreak of the Second World War, Turing became head of a codebreaking unit at Bletchley Park, home to the Government Code and Cypher School. He used his profound mathematical skill to design, with colleague Gordon Welchman, a series of huge electromechanical codebreaking machines known as ‘bombes’. These allowed the Bletchley team to crack coded messages sent by German Enigma machines – a seminal event in the history of the war. Turing also worked with more complex codes generated by Lorenz machines.
        Towards the end of the war, Turing became involved with the development of secure speech encryption systems. In 1943 he spent two months at the Bell Laboratories in the USA, working with their ‘SIGSALY’ system, and on his return to the UK he moved to Hanslope Park, Buckinghamshire, developing a technology known as ‘Delilah’.
        After the war Turing was recruited to the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, where he wrote a detailed specification for a universal digital programmable computer in 1945, to be known as the ‘ACE’ or Automatic Computing Engine. He moved to Manchester University in 1948, and in his absence his plans were realised in the ‘Pilot ACE’ computer completed in 1950, now held in the collections of the Science Museum.

ada:
  name: Ada Lovelace
  post: Ada was later asked to translate an article on Babbage's analytical engine that had been written by Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. She not only translated the original French text in English, but also added her own thoughts and ideas on the machine. Her notes ended up being three times longer than the original article. Her work was published in 1843, in an English science journal. Ada used only the initials "A.A.L.," for Augusta Ada Lovelace, in the publication.
        In her notes, Ada described how codes could be created for the device to handle letters and symbols along with numbers. She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping that computer programs use today. Ada also offered up other forward thinking concepts in the article. For her work, Ada is often considered to be the first computer programmer.
        Adas article attracted little attention when she was alive. In her later years, she tried to develop mathematical schemes for winning at gambling. Unfortunately, her schemes failed and put her in financial peril. Ada died from uterine cancer in London on November 27, 1852. She was buried next to her father, in the graveyard of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Nottingham, England.
